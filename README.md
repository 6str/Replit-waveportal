## ðŸ‘‹ Wave Portal
[Wave Portal](https://buildspace.so/p/build-solidity-web3-app) is the first [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) project I did and it brought a few other firsts too.

It was one of the first contracts I deployed to a public blockchain, the first time working with Hardhat, and it was my introduction to React.

It was a bit of challenge working on a React app with no prior knowledge, but I learned the basics along the way and started personalising the build and adding features.

I added differnt styling, a loading spinner and toast notifications, and a few other ideas too.

There's very little you can see or do with on a web3 site like this without a crypto wallet and, in this case, some Mumbai Matic, so you get the idea from the demo below.
