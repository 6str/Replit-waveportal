## Wave Portal

The Wave Portal is the first Buildspace project I did and it brought a lot of other firsts too.

It was one of the first contracts I deployed to a public blockchain, the first time I worked with Hardhat, and it was my introduction to React.

It was a bit of challenge working on a build with React with no prior knowledge, but I learned the basics along the way and started and started personalising the build.

I added styling, added a loading spinner and toast notifications, and a few other ideas 

There's very little you can see or do with a site like this without a web3 wallet and, in this case, some Mumbai Matic, but you can get the idea for picture and video below
