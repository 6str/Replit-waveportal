I'll leave this up to you: figure out how to add a textbox that lets users add their own custom message they can send to the wave function :).
The goal? You want to give your users the ability to send you a custom message using a textbox they can type in! Or, maybe you want them to send you a link to a meme? Or a Spotify link? It's up to you!
